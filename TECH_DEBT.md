# Tech debt — pending refactors

Items below are not blocking. Address them in calm windows, not during active feature work.

## 1. nginx.conf structure mismatch — RESOLVED 2026-04-29

The repo previously had a single `nginx.conf` at the root that mixed main-config
directives (`user`, `events`, `http`) with site directives (`server` blocks),
which made it impossible to deploy correctly via `cp` to either location.

**Resolution:** Split into `infra/nginx/nginx.conf` (main) and
`infra/nginx/sites-available/appforge.conf` (site), with deploy instructions in
`infra/nginx/README.md`.

## 2. Image upload field — duplicated UX across modules

**Problem:** At least 4 modules implement "image with upload + URL fallback" with slightly different markup, styles, and bugs:
- `events.module.tsx` — was missing the URL input until 2026-04-29
- `news_feed.module.tsx`
- `hero_profile.module.tsx`
- `custom_page/image.module.tsx`

Other modules will need it: `menu_restaurant` (per-item image), `catalog` (per-product), `photo_gallery`, `discount_coupon`, `loyalty_card`...

Each implementation is ~40 duplicated lines with subtle inconsistencies (different button colors, different aspect ratios, different "Subiendo..." copy).

**Fix:** Extract a shared component:

```
appforge-builder/src/components/shared/ImageUploadField.tsx

interface Props {
  value: string;                   // current imageUrl
  onChange: (url: string) => void;
  accentColor?: string;            // Tailwind color name, e.g. 'teal' | 'indigo'
  aspectRatio?: 'video' | 'square' | 'auto';
  label?: string;                  // default: "Imagen (opcional)"
  placeholder?: string;            // URL input placeholder
}
```

Internally encapsulates: preview with X button, URL input, file upload via `uploadImage()` from api.ts, "Subiendo..." state.

Migrate the 4 existing modules one by one. Reduces ~160 lines of duplication and prevents inconsistencies like the events bug.

**When to do this:** After current QA round is done, before adding new modules that need image upload.

## 3. CORS env var naming inconsistency — RESOLVED 2026-04-29

`appforge-backend/src/main.ts` previously read `process.env.BUILDER_URL` and
`process.env.ADMIN_URL` for its CORS allowlist, while the rest of the project
(including `env.production.example` and `/opt/appforge/appforge-backend/.env`)
used the `PUBLIC_*` naming convention (`PUBLIC_BUILDER_URL`, `PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL`).

This caused a silent CORS failure that surfaced after the 14:18 UTC reboot on
2026-04-29: `pm2 start` from a clean shell did not have the legacy
`BUILDER_URL`/`ADMIN_URL` exports it had been relying on, so `allowedOrigins`
became `[]` and all browser requests from `https://app.creatu.app` were
rejected at the CORS preflight stage.

**Resolution:** Updated `main.ts` to read `process.env.PUBLIC_BUILDER_URL` and
`process.env.PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL`, matching the project-wide naming convention.
Removed the temporary `BUILDER_URL` and `ADMIN_URL` entries from the
production `.env` (they were added as a hotfix earlier the same day).

## 4. Merchant PIN duplicated between Loyalty and Coupons — OPEN

`LoyaltyCard.businessPin` and `CouponMerchantConfig.businessPin` are
independent bcrypt hashes. A business that uses both modules must
configure two separate PINs and keep them in sync manually.

**Future refactor:** unify both into a single `App.merchantPin` (or a
dedicated `MerchantConfig` 1:1 with App). Migrate both models to
reference it, with a one-time data migration that copies whichever PIN
exists into the new column.

Detected: 2026-04-30 while implementing `feat(coupons): merchant PIN flow`.
Not blocking — both modules work correctly in isolation. Address when a
third "merchant validation" module is added (would force the abstraction).

## 5. Residual TypeScript errors in runtime — OPEN

`tsc --noEmit` in `appforge-runtime` reports 3 errors that Vite ignores
(the build still succeeds):

- `src/lib/manifest.ts:90` and `src/lib/platform/index.ts:9` — `Property
  'env' does not exist on type 'ImportMeta'`. Missing
  `/// <reference types="vite/client" />` in a global `.d.ts` so TS picks
  up the Vite-injected `import.meta.env` types.
- `src/modules/booking/BookingRuntime.tsx:104` — `createBooking` is called
  with a `duration` field that does not exist in its DTO. Either add
  `duration` to `CreateBookingDto` on the backend (and propagate through
  the runtime API client), or remove it from the runtime call.

**Why it matters:** `npm run build` passes because Vite uses esbuild
under the hood (no full TS type-check). But CI that runs
`npx tsc --noEmit` would flag these — meaning today we have no type-check
gate on runtime code. A regression in types could ship to production
without anyone noticing.

**Effort:** ~30 min. Add `appforge-runtime/src/vite-env.d.ts` with the
reference, decide on the booking duration field, fix the call site.

Detected: 2026-04-30 during deploy of `feat(orders): notifications`.
